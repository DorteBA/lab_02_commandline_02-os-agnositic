Type [CTRL + C] to get your prompt back.
----------



==========
5. Say good mornin' again with quotes!

$ echo "good mornin'"

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ echo "good mornin'"good mornin'


==========
6. There are some other symbols that have special meanings if you don't quote them.  For example, > brings up a different prompt.  Try *.

$ echo *

What happens?
----------
It leads you to other filies. 


==========
7. Ok... that's a lot of output.  How do we clean up our screen so that it's empty again?

Write the command that you used below:
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ clear


==========
We're going to practice downloading files from a web site.  We'll use this practice to download more lab materials!
==========
==========
8. Now let's try downloading a file from a web site.  Type in the URL *exactly* as is: google.com.

$ curl google.com

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ curl google.com
<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8">
<TITLE>301 Moved</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H1>301 Moved</H1>
The document has moved
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/">here</A>.
</BODY></HTML>


==========
9. And again.  This time, add www to the URL.

$ curl www.google.com

Copy and paste the output below, but not the whole thing!  Just copy up to the part that has the title tags (<title>......</title>).
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ curl www.google.com
<!doctype html><html itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebPage" lang="en"><head><meta content="Search the world's information, including webpages, images, videos and more.

==========
10. That's great, but what if I want to save the file?  What flag/option and option argument would I use to download the page to a file called google.html?  Run it to download the URL www.google.com.

Write the command you used below.  Also copy and paste the output below.
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ curl -o filename.txt www.google.com
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

==========
11. Now let's download the lab file for this homework.  First, figure out what directory you're in.

Write the command you used to determine your directory.  Also, copy and paste the output below.
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ pwd
/home/dortebien


==========
12. If you're not in your home directory, change to it (use the shortcut).

Write the command that you used to change to your home directory.  If you were already in your home directory, write the command that you *would* have used to change to it!
----------
~


==========
13. So... the lab materials are located at this url:

https://filebin.net/retypweqyn7h8vrg/mtec1003-lab-02.zip?t=a0ulqlss

Download the file using curl... to a file called mtec1003-lab-02.zip using the commandline.  

REMEMBER to use the -o flag, and follow it with a .zip extension! 

Use ls to verify that it downloaded.

Write down the command that you used to download the file below.  Additionally, write the output of the command below.
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ curl -o mtec1003-lab-02.zip https://filebin.net/retypweqyn7h8vrg/mtec1003-lab-02.zip?t=a0ulqlss
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  3375    0  3375    0     0   3295      0 --:--:--  0:00:01 --:--:--  3295


==========
14. We learned a command to uncompress a .zip file.  Use it to extract the files and folders from the file you just downloaded.

Write down the command that you used to uncompress the file.
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ unzip mtec1003-lab-02.zip



==========
15. Change to the directory that was just created.  List the contents (of the directory that was extracted from the labs .zip file). 

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Music  Pictures  Videos  dortebienaime  filename.txt  mtec1003  mtec1003-lab-02.zip  stuff  workspace.code-workspace


==========
We're going to mess around with archiving and compressing files.  We'll make a directory with a file in it... archive and compress it.... and uncompress it elsewhere.
==========
==========
16. Go back up to your home directory.  Create a directory called stuff.  List the contents of your home directory to prove that the directory was created.

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ mkdir stuff
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘stuff’: File exists
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ ls
Desktop        filename.txt
Documents      mtec1003
Music          mtec1003-lab-02.zip
Pictures       stuff
Videos         workspace.code-workspace
dortebienaime
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~/stuff$ 


==========
17. Change into the "stuff" directory that you just created.  Run the following command (we haven't learned this exact command yet, but we will in the next lab!) exactly as described below:

$ echo "hi" > hello.txt

List the files in the directory you're currently in (which should be stuff).  

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ cd stuff
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~/stuff$ echo "hi" > hello.txtdortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~/stuff$ ls
hello.txt


==========
18. Go up one directory back into your home directory.  Run the following commands exactly to create a compressed archive of the stuff folder.

$ tar -cvf stuff.tar stuff

List the files in the directory you're currently in (which should be home).  

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Music  Pictures  Videos  dortebienaime  filename.txt  mtec1003  mtec1003-lab-02.zip  stuff  stuff.tar  workspace.code-workspace


==========
19. Go up one directory back into your home directory.  Run the following commands exactly to create a compressed archive of the stuff folder.

$ tar -cvf stuff.tar stuff

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Music  Pictures  Videos  dortebienaime  filename.txt  mtec1003  mtec1003-lab-02.zip  stuff  stuff.tar  workspace.code-workspace


==========
20. List the files in the directory you're currently in (which should be home).  

Copy and paste the output below. (It should contain stuff.tar)
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ ls
Desktop        mtec1002-lab-02
Documents      mtec1003
Music          mtec1003-lab-02.zip
Pictures       stuff
Videos         stuff.tar
dortebienaime  workspace.code-workspace
filename.txt


==========
21. Now compress it!  Type:

gzip stuff.tar

List your files again.... you should have a new file with a .gz extension.  Copy and paste the output of your this below.
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Music  Pictures  Videos  dortebienaime  filename.txt  mtec1003  mtec1003-lab-02.zip  stuff  stuff.tar.gz  workspace.code-workspace


==========
22. Move stuff.tar.gz into the lab directory that we downloaded.  We didn't learn this command yet, so just type in exactly as is:

$ mv stuff.tar.gz mtec1002-lab-02 

MAKE SURE YOU MOVE THE FILE THAT ENDS IN .gz!

Change your directory to mtec1002-lab-02.  

List the files.  Copy and paste the output below (stuff.tar.gz should be there).
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~/mtec1002-lab-02$ ls
stuff.tar.gz

==========
23. You should be in the lab directory.  Let's uncompress the file.

$ tar -xvf stuff.tar.gz

List the files.  Copy and paste the output below (the folder, stuff, should be there).
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~/mtec1002-lab-02$ tar -xvf stuff.tar.gzstuff/
stuff/hello.txt


==========
24. Go back to your home directory
[No output]
----------



==========
25. Download and uncompress this file using curl and tar -xvf in your home directory:

https://filebin.net/retypweqyn7h8vrg/secret.tar.gz?t=5jze7uyg

REMEMBER to use the -o flag and specifiy a filenmae that ends in .tar.gz

Write out the commands that you used to do this.
----------
dortebien@DESKTOP-1CDSC8N:~$ curl -o filename.txt https://filebin.net/retypweqyn7h8vrg/secret.tar.gz?t=5jze7uyg  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
